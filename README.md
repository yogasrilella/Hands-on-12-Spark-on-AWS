# Hands-on-12-Spark-on-AWS
# Serverless Spark ETL Pipeline on AWS

This project is a hands-on assignment demonstrating a fully automated, event-driven serverless data pipeline on AWS.

The pipeline automatically ingests raw CSV product review data, processes it using a Spark ETL job, runs analytical SQL queries on the data, and saves the aggregated results back to S3.

## 🔧 Setup and Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the pipeline in your own AWS account.

### 1. Prerequisites
* An AWS Account (Free Tier is sufficient)
* Basic knowledge of S3, IAM, Lambda, and Glue

### 2. Create S3 Buckets
Create two S3 buckets with globally unique names:
* `handsonfinallanding`: This is where you will upload your raw data.
* `handsonfinalprocessed`: This is where the processed data and query results will be stored.

### 3. Create IAM Role for AWS Glue
Your Glue job needs permission to read from and write to S3.

1.  Go to the **IAM** service.
2.  Create a new **Role**.
3.  Select **AWS service** as the trusted entity and choose **Glue** as the use case.
4.  Attach the `AWSGlueServiceRole` managed policy.
5.  Attach the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy (for this demo) or a more restrictive policy that only grants access to your two buckets.
6.  Name the role `AWSGlueServiceRole-Reviews` and create it.

### 4. Create the AWS Glue ETL Job
1.  Go to the **AWS Glue** service.
2.  In the navigation pane, click on **ETL jobs**.
3.  Select the **Spark script editor** option to create a new job.
4.  Paste the contents of `src/glue_job_script.py` into the editor.
5.  Go to the **Job details** tab.
6.  Set the **Name** to `process_reviews_job`.
7.  Select the `AWSGlueServiceRole-Reviews` **IAM Role** you created in the previous step.
8.  Save the job.

> **Note:** The script is already configured to use the `handsonfinallanding` and `handsonfinalprocessed` buckets.

### 5. Create the Lambda Trigger Function
This function will start the Glue job when a file is uploaded.

1.  Go to the **AWS Lambda** service and **Create function**.
2.  Select **Author from scratch**.
3.  Set the **Function name** to `start_glue_job_trigger`.
4.  Set the **Runtime** to **Python 3.10** (or any modern Python runtime).
5.  **Permissions:** Under "Change default execution role," select **Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions**. This role will be automatically named.
6.  Create the function.

#### 5a. Add Lambda Code
Paste the contents of `src/lambda_function.py` into the code editor. Make sure the `GLUE_JOB_NAME` variable matches the name of your Glue job (`process_reviews_job`).

#### 5b. Add Lambda Permissions
The new Lambda role needs permission to start a Glue job.
1.  Go to the function's **Configuration** > **Permissions** tab and click the role name.
2.  In the IAM console, click **Add permissions** > **Create inline policy**.
3.  Use the JSON editor and paste the following policy:
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "glue:StartJobRun",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
4.  Name the policy `Allow-Glue-StartJobRun` and save it.

#### 5c. Add the S3 Trigger
1.  Go back to your Lambda function's main page.
2.  Click **Add trigger**.
3.  Select **S3** as the source.
4.  Select your `handsonfinallanding` bucket.
5.  Set the **Event type** to `s3:ObjectCreated:*` (or "All object create events").
6.  Acknowledge the recursive invocation warning and click **Add**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Pipeline

Your pipeline is now fully deployed and automated!

1.  Take the sample `reviews.csv` file from the `data/` directory.
2.  Upload `reviews.csv` to the root of your `handsonfinallanding` S3 bucket.
3.  This will trigger the Lambda, which in turn starts the Glue job.
4.  You can monitor the job's progress in the **AWS Glue** console under the **Monitoring** tab.

## 📈 Query Results

After the job (which may take 2-3 minutes to run), navigate to your `handsonfinalprocessed` bucket. You will find the results in the `Athena Results/` folder, organized into sub-folders for each query:

* `s3://handsonfinalprocessed/Athena Results/daily_review_counts/`
* `s3://handsonfinalprocessed/Athena Results/top_5_customers/`
* `s3://handsonfinalprocessed/Athena Results/rating_distribution/`

You will also find the complete, cleaned dataset in `s3://handsonfinalprocessed/processed-data/`.

## 🧹 Cleanup

To avoid any future charges (especially if you're on the Free Tier), be sure to delete the resources you created:
1.  Empty and delete the `handsonfinallanding` and `handsonfinalprocessed` S3 buckets.
2.  Delete the `start_glue_job_trigger` Lambda function.
3.  Delete the `process_reviews_job` Glue job.
4.  Delete the `AWSGlueServiceRole-Reviews` IAM role.
